            "content_html": "<p>Sarees are a loud and proud piece of Indian culture, prominently displaying the different facets and histories of one of the oldest cultures on the planet through their unique patterns, natural dyes, and lustrous textiles.</p>\n<p>I started our company to make it easier for these vivacious pieces of art to be loved and worn halfway across the world from where they originate.</p>\n<p>Tales of Threads and I proudly stand by the fact that the authenticity and superb quality of our sarees can be observed in their every facet. Each saree is hand selected, checked for quality at every step, and sourced from artisans local to the area where each type of saree originated; their craft passed down from generation to generation over centuries of time. We cut the middle man and go directly to the source to ensure you pay the same price but the people who put in their hard work get fair-pay.</p>\n<p>Our sarees tell a story. A story of passion, and culture and care and a story of all the people who have loved them in their creation: from the ancient citizens who invented the style, the artisans who made it, the business that carefully selected it, and finally you.</p>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\">Â </div>",
