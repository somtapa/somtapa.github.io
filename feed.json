Each saree is hand selected, checked for quality at every step, and sourced from artisans local to the area where each type of saree originated; their craft passed down from generation to generation over centuries of time. We cut the middle man and go directly to the source to ensure you pay the same price but the people who put in their hard work get fair-pay.</p>\n<p>Our sarees tell a story. A story of passion, and culture and care and a story of all the people who have loved them in their creation: from the ancient citizens who invented the style, the artisans who made it, the business that carefully selected it, and finally you.</p>\n<div class=\"yj6qo ajU\"> </div>",
