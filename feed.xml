                <div>Kalamkari sarees -from the words "kalam" meaning pen and "kari" meaning art. these were first found as an art form in the lush lands of Golconda, Andhra Pradesh.</div>
<div>The unique feature of kalamkari art is that it uses only natural colors or vegetable dyes.</div>
<div>For instance black color used for outlining sketches is extracted by blending jaggery, water and iron filings. </div>
<div>This art involves 23 steps of dyeing. Our Kalamkaris are hand-drawn and made by the Kalamkars of Srikalahasti, directly sourced from artisans whose skills and techniques have been passed down from generation to generation. After painting the sarees, they are exposed to the elements so as to bring the colors of your saree to life and create the fine piece of art that you have purchased for your closet.</div>
<div>One of the first steps of making Kalamkari, is boiling the base fabric in buffalo milk. When you get a kalamkari saree from Tale of Threads, you will be welcomed by the aroma of the milk still lingering, a mark of it's authenticity.</div>

                <div><strong>Ajrakh</strong>, is a unique form of block printing found mostly in Ajrakhpur, Kuch. The name Ajrakh is derived from the Arabic word AZRAK that means blue. This particular art form is influenced by Sufism in the choice of the patterns and colors used for printing.</div>
<div>Ajrakh block printing  predominantly uses dark colors like blue, red, black and the patterns are mostly geometric in shape.</div>
<div><span style="color: #202122; font-family: sans-serif;">One of the main techniques used in ajrak printing is called Do- Rukha, where the printing is done on both sides of the fabric. The artisans use "resist dyeing" and block printing together to make it a coveted art.</span></div>
<div>Ajrakh was mainly produced by a community of people called KHATRI, artisans for the cattle herders of the region, the Maldhari men who later migrated to Dhamadka.</div>
<div>After the earthquake in Dhamadka and Bhuj, a village called ajrakhpur was set up to practice this art.</div>

                <p>Lambani is an art of embellishing clothes practiced by the Lambadas or Lambanis, the tribe in Sanduru, the Banjaras of Bellary and Bijapur in Karnataka, Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh.  Lambada are a historically nomadic trading tribe who reside in South, West &amp; Central India and with a language of their own called ‘Gar Boli ‘ .</p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">In the Mughal era, the community was engaged in transporting provisions and trading goods. Their habit of living in isolated groups, away from others, still persists and they live in settlements, on the fringes of towns..</span></p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Lambada embroidery consists of patchwork, appliqué, beadwork and embroidery together.  </span></p>
<p><span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">There are 14 types of stitches used in Banjara embroidery. They are Kilan, Vele, Bakkya, Maki, Suryakanti Maki, Kans, Tera Dora, Kaudi, Relo, Gadri, Bhuriya, Pote, Jollya, Nakra.</span></p>
<div>
<div dir="auto">
<div dir="auto">The embroidery is truly unique in its style and the matchless quality is achieved with a combination of brightness and originality. The colorful threads used in the embroidery are largely symbolic of the vibrant lifestyle of Banjaras.</div>

                <p>Sarees are a loud and proud piece of Indian culture, prominently displaying the different facets and histories of one of the oldest cultures on the planet through their unique patterns, natural dyes, and lustrous textiles.</p>
<p>I started our company to make it easier for these vivacious pieces of art to be loved and worn halfway across the world from where they originate.</p>
<p>Tales of Threads and I proudly stand by the fact that the authenticity and superb quality of our sarees can be observed in their every facet. Each saree is hand selected, checked for quality at every step, and sourced from artisans local to the area where each type of saree originated; their craft passed down from generation to generation over centuries of time. We cut the middle man and go directly to the source to ensure you pay the same price but the people who put in their hard work get fair-pay.</p>
<p>Our sarees tell a story. A story of passion, and culture and care and a story of all the people who have loved them in their creation: from the ancient citizens who invented the style, the artisans who made it, the business that carefully selected it, and finally you.</p>
